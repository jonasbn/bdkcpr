Release 0.03 - Released Wed Mar 13 2007 Update not necessary

- Added Perl::Critic test t/critic.t and related t/perlcriticrc, we currently
  pass at severity 5, gentle

- Updated to more contemporary versions of:
    t/pod-coverage.t
    t/pod.t

  These should be there for the quality, but will not be run as a part of the
  normal test run, unless the TEST_POD environment variable is set.
  
  This seem to be the defacto way of doing things.


Release 0.02 - Released Wed Mar 1 2006 Update not necessary

- Fixed a small POD error, reported by htoug (thanks)


Release 0.01 - Released Tue Feb 21 2006

- Initial version
